This project examines the age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure of selected individuals 
to assess their relationship with diabetes. It explores the interactions among these variables to gain 
deeper insights into diabetes.

The project seeks to answer key questions related to these variables and their connection to diabetes.

1. How does age affect blood pressure, and is there a particular age range where blood pressure tends
   to be highest or lowest?

3. Is there a gender-based difference in BMI across different age groups, and how does this gender-age
   interaction impact overall health?

3. What is the relationship between BMI and blood pressure, and are the specific BMI categories associated
   with elevated or reduced blood pressure?

4. "There is a significant gender-based difference in the average BMI among adults". This hypothesis is going
   to be tested using a two-sample t-test to compare the mean BMI of males and females. This study can help to
   determine whether gender is associated with differences in BMI and whether specific gender-based health
   interventions are necessary.
